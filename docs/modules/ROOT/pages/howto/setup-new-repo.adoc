= Setup a new Repository
Sebastian Sommerfeld <sebastian@fb-brunnenbau>

Setting a new repository on Github should follow the same process to make sure all repos follow the same configuration and layout.

== Creating a new Repository
All repositories within the link:https://github.com/fb-brunnenbau[fb-brunnenbau GitHub organization] adhere to a standardized setup, ensuring consistency and coherence across projects. This uniform approach enables streamlined collaboration, ease of navigation, and familiarity for contributors across the organization.

=== Things to do
. Create repository on Github in the link:https://github.com/fb-brunnenbau[fb-brunnenbau] organization
. Use link:https://github.com/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/jarvis[Jarvis] to setup an Antora module
. Use link:https://github.com/sebastian-sommerfeld-io/jarvis[Jarvis] to setup arc42 docs inside the Antora module (if needed)
. Create all basic Github Actions workflows for this repository (see link:/.github/main[``.github``'s docs] for furher information)
. Use `gh repo edit --enable-discussions --enable-issues --enable-projects --enable-wiki=false --visibility=public` to configure the remote repository
. Create secrets for this repository (if needed) and document them
. Create organization secrets (if needed) and document them
. Link repository to a project

=== Things not to do
. Do not create Issue Templates or Pull Request templates - these files are automatically inherited from the special `.github` repository
. Do not create linter definitions files - these file are automatically generated and regularly updated by the "Housekeeping: Repository" workflow

=== Things you can do if you like
There is no need to setup the following files because a basic configuration is automatically generated by the "Housekeeping: Repository" workflow. However if the respective file is present, it will not be overwridden. So you can create these config yourself and make changes without having them reverted

. `.github/dependabot.yml`
. `.gitignore`
